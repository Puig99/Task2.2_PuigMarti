# Task2.2_PuigMarti
We can apply a few formats while use a markdown document.
For example: 

# Headers
That go from h1 to h6, we use # to define them.

*Emphasis*

Which can be used putting the words between two *, can be done with _underscores_ ( _ ) too. They can be **Combined in _one_ sentence**

# Lists

To make lists we use *, or numbers followed by a dot to make ordered lists

* First item
* Second item

1. First item
2. second item

# Links

We have two ways of creating a link, using [ ]( ), or just using [ ]
[This is a test link](https://www.google.com)

# Images
We insert images the same way we insert links
